Equipment Loadouts allows up to 10 different loadouts. Each loadout will have its own armor, accessories, vanities, dyes, and miscellaneous equipment.
You can make the menu draggable by clicking on the yellow lock (to unlock) and then save its position by locking it again.

There are two commands:
 - /swaploadout 1 would swap your active profile with profile 1
 - /swaploadout 1 2 would swap profile 1 with profile 2

Check the mod's homepage for a short video preview.
